    This application aims to provide an extra layer of protection to your Android
    device like never before! It allows the user to make a four step unlock pattern
    by moving their device in various directions of their choosing. The internal 
    accelerometer sensors make detecting this kind of movement possible and provide
    an abundance of data. The fun/challenging part is controlling the data from these
    sensors since it is often very sensitive and noisy.\n
